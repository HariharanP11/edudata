# 🎯 EduData Platform - Smart India Hackathon 2024

## "One Nation, One Education Data" - Unified Education Data Interface

### 📋 Problem Statement
In today's scenario, there is no unified mechanism to store, access, analyze, and retrieve educational data across:
- **Institutions** (NIRF ranking, compliance, performance, research)
- **Teachers** (APAR, research, training, teaching outcomes) 
- **Students** (academic lifecycle, attendance, scholarships, placements)
- **Government Schemes** (eligibility, beneficiaries, impact)

Data is scattered across multiple portals making it difficult to track student lifecycle, map beneficiaries, monitor performance, and ensure transparency.

### ✨ Our Solution
A **unified web platform** that consolidates all education-related data into a single interface using **role-based dashboards** with real-time analytics and AI-powered recommendations.

## 🚀 Quick Demo
1. Run the application: `npm run dev`
2. **NEW**: Click the **"🚀 SIH 2024 Revolutionary Demo 🚀"** button on homepage
3. Experience cutting-edge Quantum Analytics, AR/VR Education, Neural AI, and Holographic Visualization
4. Alternative: Click the **"SIH Demo"** button (bottom-right) for role-based tour
5. Experience the complete workflow from public view → student → teacher → institution → government → admin
